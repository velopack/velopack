# Velopack
Velopack is an installation and auto-update framework for cross-platform applications. It's opinionated, extremely easy to use with zero config needed. With just one command you can be up and running with an installable application, and it's lightning fast for your users, too.

## Features

- 😍 **Zero config** – Velopack takes your compiler output and generates an installer, updates, delta packages, and self-updating portable package in just one command.
- 🎯 **Cross platform** – Velopack supports building packages for **Windows**, **OSX**, and **Linux**, so you can use one solution for every target.
- 🚀 **Automatic migrations** - If you are coming from other popular frameworks (eg. [Squirrel](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows)), Velopack can automatically migrate your application.
- ⚡️ **Lightning fast** – Velopack is written in Rust for native performance. Delta packages mean your user only downloads what's changed between versions.
- 📔 **Language agnostic** - With support for C#, C++, JS, Rust and more. Use a familiar API for updates no matter what language your project is.
